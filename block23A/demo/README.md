# Block 24A: Functional Programming

Guided in-class project for Block 24A. 

In this project we will learn about functional programming:
* Higher-order functions
* Curried functions
* Partial application functions
* Composition functions

## Objectives
- Write code that passes functions as arguments.
- Write functions that return other functions as the return value.
- Compose a sequence of functions into a single function.
- Create curried functions
- Understand the distinction between partial application and currying.
- Create new functions by partially applying existing functions.

## Instructions to run this project
- Using your command line, navigate into the project folder
- Run `npm i` in your command line to install the necessary files
