# Guided Practice - Music

For this guided practice, you will practice using `fetch` to communicate with an API that serves data about musicians. The goal is to get you comfortable with the process of making a request, parsing the response, and using the data to update state.

Read through [the API documentation](https://fsa-crud-2aa9294fe819.herokuapp.com/api/). You will be working with the `/artists` endpoint.

Some starter code has been provided for you, so make sure to read through it before you begin working on the prompts.

## Prompts

The answers can be viewed directly below the respective prompt. The `solution` branch contains the final code.

1. Write `getArtists()`; the goal is to make a GET request to the API and update the state with the response data. You can check `state` in the console to see if the data is successfully fetched.

   ```js
   async function getArtists() {
     try {
       const response = await fetch(API_URL);
       const json = await response.json();
       state.artists = json.data;
     } catch (error) {
       console.error(error);
     }
   }
   ```

   </details>

1. Complete `renderArtists` so that it renders the artists in state. The page should contain the name, image, and bio of each artist. If state is empty, then a corresponding message should be displayed.

   ```js
   function renderArtists() {
     if (!state.artists.length) {
       artistList.innerHTML = "<li>No artists.</li>";
       return;
     }

     const artistCards = state.artists.map((artist) => {
       const li = document.createElement("li");
       li.innerHTML = `
         <h2>${artist.name}</h2>
         <img src="${artist.imageUrl}" alt="${artist.name}" />
         <p>${artist.description}</p>
       `;
       return li;
     });

     artistList.replaceChildren(...artistCards);
   }
   ```

   </details>

1. Complete `addArtist()` so that it makes a POST request to the API with data from the form. The page should automatically rerender with the new artist added to the list.

   ```js
   async function addArtist(event) {
     event.preventDefault();

     try {
       const response = await fetch(API_URL, {
         method: "POST",
         headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
         body: JSON.stringify({
           name: addArtistForm.name.value,
           imageUrl: addArtistForm.imageUrl.value,
           description: addArtistForm.description.value,
         }),
       });

       if (!response.ok) {
         throw new Error("Failed to create artist");
       }

       render();
     } catch (error) {
       console.error(error);
     }
   }
   ```

   </details>

## Extensions

If you're done early, try to implement one or more of the following features:

- Allow users to delete an artist by clicking on a button
- Allow users to submit a form to update an existing artist
